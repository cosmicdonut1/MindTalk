# Project Title

EEG-Based Meditation Assistant

## Project Description

This project is an EEG-based meditation assistant that monitors brain activity to determine the mental state of the user. If the user becomes distracted, the system uses OpenAIâ€™s GPT-3 to generate a gentle reminder to refocus on meditation. 

Please note that the real-time EEG analysis part of the project has been removed for now and will be added later as it is currently under patent review.
